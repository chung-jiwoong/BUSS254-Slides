## Problem

XYZ stock price and dividend history are as follows:

| Year | Beginning-of-year Price | Dividend paid at Year-End |
|------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| 2010 | \$100                    | \$4                       |
| 2011 | \$110                    | \$4                       |
| 2012 | \$90                     | \$4                       |
| 2013 | \$95                     | \$4                       |

###

What are the arithmetic and geometric average rates of return for the investor? (Note, these are also called time-weighted average rate of returns)

**Solution:**

First, calculate the returns for each year:

*   2010: $(\$110 + \$4 - \$100) / \$100 = 0.14 = 14\%$
*   2011: $(\$90 + \$4 - \$110) / \$110 = -0.1455 = -14.55\%$
*   2012: $(\$95 + \$4 - \$90) / \$90 = 0.10 = 10\%$

Arithmetic average return: $(0.14 - 0.1455 + 0.10) / 3 = 0.0315 = 3.15\%$

Geometric average return: $[(1 + 0.14) \times (1 - 0.1455) \times (1 + 0.10)]^{1/3} - 1 = 0.0271 = 2.71\%$

###

An investor buys three shares of XYZ at the beginning of 2010, buys another two shares at the beginning of 2011, sells one share at the beginning of 2012, and sells all four remaining shares at the beginning of 2013. What is the internal rate of return (a.k.a., dollar-weighted rate of return)?

**Solution:**

This requires finding the discount rate that makes the present value of all cash flows equal to zero.

*   Time 0 (Beginning of 2010): -$300 (3 shares @ \$100)
*   Time 1 (Beginning of 2011): -$220 (2 shares @ \$110) + \$12 (Dividends) = -$208
*   Time 2 (Beginning of 2012):  +\$90 (1 share @ \$90) + \$20 (5 shares x \$4 dividend) = \$110
*   Time 3 (Beginning of 2013):  +\$380 (4 shares @ \$95) + \$16 (4 shares x \$4 dividend) = \$396

Using a financial calculator or spreadsheet software, find the IRR that solves:

$−300 + \frac{-208}{(1 + I)} + \frac{110}{(1 + I)^2} + \frac{396}{(1 + I)^3} = 0$

The IRR is approximately 10.71%.

## Problem

The following table is a simple scenario of the stock market:

| Scenario         | Probability | Holding-period return (%) |
|------------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Severe recession | 0.01        | -40                       |
| Mild Recession   | 0.09        | -10                       |
| Normal           | 0.60        | +5                        |
| Mild growth      | 0.20        | +12                       |
| Boom             | 0.10        | +60                       |

###

Calculate the expected return and the standard deviation of the holding-period return.

**Solution:**

Expected Return:

$E[R] = (0.01 \times -40) + (0.09 \times -10) + (0.60 \times 5) + (0.20 \times 12) + (0.10 \times 60) = 8.5\%$

Standard Deviation:

$\sigma = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i (R_i - E[R])^2}$

$\sigma = \sqrt{0.01(-40 - 8.5)^2 + 0.09(-10 - 8.5)^2 + 0.6(5 - 8.5)^2 + 0.2(12 - 8.5)^2 + 0.1(60 - 8.5)^2} = 15.95\%$

###

What is the fifth-percentile value at risk (VaR) of the holding-period return, i.e., VaR at 5%.

**Solution:**

VaR at 5% means the return that you expect to happen only 5% of the time. Looking at the scenarios and their probabilities:

*   Severe recession: 1% probability, -40% return
*   Mild recession: 9% probability, -10% return

Since the severe recession scenario has a 1% probability and the mild recession has a 9% probability, the fifth percentile VaR is the return associated with the mild recession, i.e., -10%.

###

Repeat part (b) for the one-percentile value at risk (VaR) of the holding-period return.

**Solution:**

Since the severe recession scenario has a 1% probability, the one-percentile VaR is the return associated with the severe recession, i.e., -40%.

## Problem

Warren is currently holding a portfolio comprising 40% in stock A and 60% in stock B. The expected returns on stocks A and B are 20% and 10%, respectively and the standard deviation of stocks A and B are 25% and 16%, respectively. The correlation coefficient of stocks A and B is 0.5 and the return on T-bill is 3%. [Sharpe ratio = $(E[R]-R_f)/\sigma$]

###

Compute the expected return and standard deviation of Warren's portfolio.

**Solution:**

Given:

*   $w_A = 0.4$, $w_B = 0.6$
*   $E[R_A] = 0.20$, $E[R_B] = 0.10$
*   $\sigma_A = 0.25$, $\sigma_B = 0.16$
*   $\rho_{AB} = 0.5$
*   $R_f = 0.03$

Expected return of the portfolio:

$E[R_P] = w_A E[R_A] + w_B E[R_B] = (0.4 \times 0.20) + (0.6 \times 0.10) = 0.14 = 14\%$

Standard deviation of the portfolio:

$\sigma_P = \sqrt{w_A^2 \sigma_A^2 + w_B^2 \sigma_B^2 + 2w_A w_B \rho_{AB} \sigma_A \sigma_B}$

$\sigma_P = \sqrt{(0.4^2 \times 0.25^2) + (0.6^2 \times 0.16^2) + (2 \times 0.4 \times 0.6 \times 0.5 \times 0.25 \times 0.16)} = 0.1735 = 17.35\%$

###

Which of the following changes will be most preferred by Warren?

1.  Standard deviation of stocks A and B reduce to 16% and 9%, respectively;
2.  The correlation coefficient of stocks A and B changes to $-0.5$; or
3.  The expected return on stock A increases to 30%.

**Solution:**

The best approach to solve this problem is to compare Sharp Ratio of the new portfolios.

1.  Reduced standard deviations:

$\sigma_P = \sqrt{(0.4^2 \times 0.16^2) + (0.6^2 \times 0.09^2) + (2 \times 0.4 \times 0.6 \times 0.5 \times 0.16 \times 0.09)} = 0.0872 = 8.72\%$

Sharpe Ratio = $(0.14 - 0.03) / 0.0872 = 1.26$

2.  Correlation coefficient changes to $-0.5$:

$\sigma_P = \sqrt{(0.4^2 \times 0.25^2) + (0.6^2 \times 0.16^2) + (2 \times 0.4 \times 0.6 \times -0.5 \times 0.25 \times 0.16)} = 0.1249 = 12.49\%$

Sharpe Ratio = $(0.14 - 0.03) / 0.1249 = 0.88$

3.  Expected return on A increases to 30%:

$E[R_P] = (0.4 \times 0.30) + (0.6 \times 0.10) = 0.18 = 18\%$

Sharpe Ratio = $(0.18 - 0.03) / 0.1735 = 0.86$

Comparing the Sharpe ratios, Warren would prefer the first change (reduced standard deviations), as it results in the highest Sharpe ratio.
