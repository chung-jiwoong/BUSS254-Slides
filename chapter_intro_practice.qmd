## Problem

XYZ stock price and dividend history are as follows:

| Year | Beginning-of-year Price | Dividend paid at Year-End |
|------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| 2010 | \$100                    | \$4                       |
| 2011 | \$110                    | \$4                       |
| 2012 | \$90                     | \$4                       |
| 2013 | \$95                     | \$4                       |

### 

What are the arithmetic and geometric average rates of return for the investor? (Note, these are also called time-weighted average rate of returns)

### 

An investor buys three shares of XYZ at the beginning of 2010, buys another two shares at the beginning of 2011, sells one share at the beginning of 2012, and sells all four remaining shares at the beginning of 2013. What is the internal rate of return (a.k.a., dollar-weighted rate of return)?

## Problem

The following table is a simple scenario of the stock market:

| Scenario         | Probability | Holding-period return (%) |
|------------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Severe recession | 0.01        | -40                       |
| Mild Recession   | 0.09        | -10                       |
| Normal           | 0.60        | +5                        |
| Mild growth      | 0.20        | +12                       |
| Boom             | 0.10        | +60                       |

### 

Calculate the expected return and the standard deviation of the holding-period return.

### 

What is the fifth-percentile value at risk (VaR) of the holding-period return, i.e., VaR at 5%.

### 

Repeat part (b) for the one-percentile value at risk (VaR) of the holding-period return.

## Problem

Warren is currently holding a portfolio comprising 40% in stock A and 60% in stock B. The expected returns on stocks A and B are 20% and 10%, respectively and the standard deviation of stocks A and B are 25% and 16%, respectively. The correlation coefficient of stocks A and B is 0.5 and the return on T-bill is 3%. [Sharpe ratio = $(E[R]-R_f)/\sigma$]

###

Compute the expected return and standard deviation of Warren's portfolio.

###

Which of the following changes will be most preferred by Warren?

1. Standard deviation of stocks A and B reduce to 16% and 9%, respectively;
2. The correlation coefficient of stocks A and B changes to $-0.5$; or
3. The expected return on stock A increases to 30%.

## Problem

Download **Hyundai Motor (005380.KQ) and Tesla (TSLA)** daily stock returns for the year **2024** using the `quantmod` package. **Daily arithmetic and geometric average returns** for both stocks. **Standard deviation of returns**, which measures risk.

Copy and paste the following R code into an R script in **RStudio**, then execute it by clicking **"Run"**.


```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
# Load necessary packages
library(quantmod)
library(PerformanceAnalytics)
library(zoo)  # For missing value handling

# Download stock data from Yahoo Finance
symbols <- c("005380.KQ", "TSLA")
getSymbols(symbols, src = "yahoo", from = "2024-01-01", to = Sys.Date(), auto.assign = TRUE)

# Extract adjusted closing prices
hyundai_prices <- Cl(get("005380.KQ"))
tesla_prices <- Cl(TSLA)

# Handle missing values for Hyundai Motor
hyundai_prices <- na.omit(hyundai_prices)  # Interpolate missing values

# Compute daily returns and remove any remaining missing values
hyundai_returns <- na.omit(dailyReturn(hyundai_prices))
tesla_returns <- na.omit(dailyReturn(tesla_prices))

# Compute arithmetic mean return
arithmetic_mean_hyundai <- mean(hyundai_returns)
arithmetic_mean_tesla <- mean(tesla_returns)

# Compute geometric mean return
geometric_mean_hyundai <- prod(1 + hyundai_returns)^(1 / length(hyundai_returns)) - 1
geometric_mean_tesla <- prod(1 + tesla_returns)^(1 / length(tesla_returns)) - 1

# Compute standard deviation
std_dev_hyundai <- sd(hyundai_returns)
std_dev_tesla <- sd(tesla_returns)

# Print results
cat("Hyundai Motor - Arithmetic Mean Return:", round(arithmetic_mean_hyundai, 6), "\n")
cat("Hyundai Motor - Geometric Mean Return:", round(geo_mean_hyundai, 6), "\n")
cat("Hyundai Motor - Standard Deviation:", round(std_dev_hyundai, 6), "\n\n")

cat("Tesla - Arithmetic Mean Return:", round(arithmetic_mean_tesla, 6), "\n")
cat("Tesla - Geometric Mean Return:", round(geo_mean_tesla, 6), "\n")
cat("Tesla - Standard Deviation:", round(std_dev_tesla, 6), "\n")
