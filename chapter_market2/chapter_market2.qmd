## Capital Markets

*   Money market instruments include short-term, marketable, liquid, low-risk debt securities.
*   Capital markets, in contrast, include longer term and riskier securities.
*   Securities in the capital market are much more diverse than those found within the money market.

    *   Bond market: longer term borrowing or debt instruments, fixed-income capital market
    *   Stock market: corporate ownership is traded

## Bond Market: Asset-Backed Securities

 *   Securities created by pooling together typically *illiquid* assets and then "securitizing" them into marketable securities.
   
*   **Underlying Asset Pools:**  Common types of assets used to create ABS include:

    *   **Mortgages (MBS):**  Home loans
    *   **Loans (CLO):**  Corporate loans
    *   **Bonds (CBO):**  Corporate bonds
    *   **Credit Card Receivables (CARD):**  Outstanding balances on credit cards

*   Transfer of ownership of the underlying assets from the asset originator to a special purpose company/vehicle
  
*   **2008 Financial Crisis Connection:**  Complex and poorly understood ABS, particularly those backed by subprime mortgages, played a significant role in the 2008 financial crisis.  This highlighted risks associated with ABS, including:

    *   **Complexity:** Difficult to assess the true risk of ABS due to their intricate structure.
    *   **Opacity:** Lack of transparency in the underlying asset pools.
    *   **Incentive Problems:** Originators had weak incentives to properly vet the loans.

![](img/market_Securitization.png)
:::

*   **Securitization Process** involves:

    *   **Asset Transfer:**  Transferring ownership of the underlying assets from the originator (e.g., a bank) to a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) or company.
    *   **SPV:** Isolates the assets, bankruptcy remoteness, and allows the SPV to issue new securities backed by those assets.
    *   **Creating Securities:** SPV creates and sells new securities (the ABS) to investors.  These securities derive their value from the cash flows generated by the underlying assets.

## Bond Market: Covered Bonds & Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Bond

**Covered Bonds**

- **Similar to Asset-Backed Securities (ABS)** but with key differences:  
  - **Cover pool remains on the issuer’s balance sheet** (unlike ABS, where assets are transferred to an SPV).  
  - Investors have **dual recourse**:  
    - First, to the issuing financial institution.  
    - Second, to the **underlying asset pool (cover pool)** in case of default.  
- Functions as a **corporate bond** issued by financial institutions, with an **extra layer of protection** for investors.  
- **More common in Europe**, especially in **Germany (Pfandbriefe)**, but also in **Denmark, France, and Spain**.  

**Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Bonds (FESFBs)**

- **Foreign currency-denominated bonds** issued by the **Korean government** in **international bond markets**.  
- **Objectives:**  
  - Establishes **benchmark interest rates** for Korean bonds in global markets.  
  - **Supports foreign exchange stability** by securing external financing.  
  - Helps manage **Korea’s foreign exchange reserves** effectively.  
- Typically issued in **USD, EUR, or JPY**, providing a reference for Korean corporate and sovereign issuers abroad.

## Stock Markets: Cross-listing

- The practice of listing a company's equity shares on one or more foreign exchanges.
- The number of cross-listed firms has grown rapidly, now representing about 10% of publicly traded companies worldwide.
- The primary motivation for cross-listing is to reduce the firm's cost of capital by increasing investor access and improving liquidity.

- Types of Cross-listing
  1. Direct Listing
     - A company lists its shares on a foreign exchange without issuing new equity.
     - Requires compliance with the listing regulations of the foreign exchange.

  2. Depositary Receipts (DRs)
     - A financial instrument representing shares of a foreign company, held in custody by a domestic bank.
     - Enables investors to trade foreign stocks more easily on their home market.

- Types of Depositary Receipts: American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), European Depositary Receipts (EDRs), Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs), Indian Depository Receipts (IDRs)

---

## Stock Market Indices

- A hypothetical portfolio representing a segment of the financial market.
- Used as a barometer of market performance and an investment benchmark.

- Key Uses of Stock Market Indices:
  - Market performance measurement: Indicates overall stock market trends.
  - Performance benchmarking: Compares the returns of money managers and funds.
  - Passive investment strategies: Forms the basis for index funds, ETFs, and passive portfolio management.
  - Foundation for derivatives: Many futures, options, and swaps are based on stock indices.

- Types of Stock Market Indices: Indices vary based on:
  - Market representation: Sector-based, regional, size-based indices, etc.
  - Weighting schemes: Market-cap weighted, price-weighted, equal-weighted, etc.

---


## Stock Market Indices (cont'd)

- Price-Weighted Index
  - Each company's stock is weighted by its price per share, and the index is an average of the share prices of all the companies.
  - Greater weight is given to stocks with higher prices.
  - Initially, this is similar to investing in equal numbers of shares of each stock, but weighting changes over time due to stock splits and price fluctuations.
  - Examples: DJIA, Nikkei 225.

- Market Value-Weighted Index
  - Individual components are weighted according to their relative total market capitalization.  
  - Most indices use free-floating market capitalization, meaning they consider only shares available for public trading rather than total market capitalization.
  - Companies with higher market capitalization receive a higher weighting in the index.
  - Investing in proportion to market value (buy-and-hold).
  - Examples: S&P 500, NASDAQ, KOSPI, KOSDAQ.

- Equal-Weighted Index
  - Each stock is assigned an equal weight, meaning the index value is the simple arithmetic average of stock returns.
  - Investing equal dollar values in each stock requires continuous rebalancing.
  - Examples: S&P 500 Equal Weight, MSCI Equal Weight.


---

## Stock Market Indices: Example

| Stock | P1  | Q1  | P2 (No split) | Q2 (No split) | P2 (Split) | Q2 (Split) |
|-------|-----|-----|---------------|---------------|------------|------------|
| A     | $10$ | $40$  | $15$       | $40$          | $15$       | 40$        |
| B     | $50$ | $80$  | $50$       | $80$          | $25$       | 160$       |
| C     | $140$ | $50$  | $150$     | $50$          | $150$      | 50$        |


***Price-Weighted Index***

- **Day 1:** $(10+50+140)/3=66.67$
- **Day 2 - No split:** $(15+50+150)/3=71.67$
- **Day 2 - Split:**
    - Find $d$ such that $(10+25+140)/d=66.67$, solving for $d$ gives $d=2.625$.
    - Then, $(15+25+150)/2.625=72.38$

- $d$ is called the **Dow Divisor**, which is continuously adjusted for corporate actions such as dividend payments and stock splits.
- As of December 2021, the divisor for DJIA is $0.15172752595384$.
- With a stock split, the change in the index does **not** represent the actual investment outcome of holding one share of each stock:
  $72.38/66.67=8.57\%\neq71.67/66.67=7.5\%$

## Stock Market Indices: Example (cont'd)

| Stock | P1  | Q1  | P2 (No split) | Q2 (No split) | P2 (Split) | Q2 (Split) |
|-------|-----|-----|---------------|---------------|------------|------------|
| A     | $10$ | $40$  | $15$       | $40$          | $15$       | 40$        |
| B     | $50$ | $80$  | $50$       | $80$          | $25$       | 160$       |
| C     | $140$ | $50$  | $150$     | $50$          | $150$      | 50$        |


***Market Value-Weighted Index***

- **Day 1:** $(400+4,000+7,000)=11,400$
- **Day 2:** $(600+4,000+7,500)=12,100$
    - Using **Day 1 as the base year** (e.g., setting it equal to 100)
    - **Day 2 index:** $12,100/11,400\times100=106.14$

- If you invest in proportion to market value (i.e., 3.50% in A, 35.07% in B, and 61.40% in C), the return is:
  $3.50\%\times(600/400-1)+35.07\%\times(4,000/4,000-1)+61.40\%\times(7,500/7,000-1)=6.14\%$

  $\left(\frac{1}{3}\times\frac{600}{400}+\frac{1}{3}\times\frac{4,000}{4,000}+\frac{1}{3}\times\frac{7,500}{7,000}\right)\times100=119.04$

- If you invest an equal amount (e.g., $700$) in each stock, meaning 70 shares of A, 14 shares of B, and 5 shares of C, the return is:
  $\frac{1}{3}\times\left(\frac{600}{400}-1\right)+\frac{1}{3}\times\left(\frac{4,000}{4,000}-1\right)+\frac{1}{3}\times\left(\frac{7,500}{7,000}-1\right)=19.04\%$

- When using **market-value weighting**, large-cap stocks are overweighted.
- When using **equal weighting**, small-cap stocks are overweighted.

## Bond Market Indices

- Bond market indices track the performance of a portfolio of bonds, serving as benchmarks for bond investors.
  - Investors use bond indices to assess interest rate movements, credit risk, and overall bond market performance.

- Unlike stock indices, which rely on frequently traded prices, bond indices face challenges due to infrequent trading and pricing difficulties.

---

## Well-Known Bond Market Indices

- **Bloomberg Barclays Bond Indices**:  
  - Covers government, corporate, and municipal bonds across different maturities and risk levels.  
  - Examples: Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index.
  
- **ICE BofA (Merrill Lynch) Bond Indices**:  
  - Tracks corporate and government bonds, commonly used for high-yield and investment-grade bonds.  
  - Example: ICE BofA U.S. High Yield Index.

- **FTSE Russell Bond Indices (Citi)**:  
  - Offers broad and sector-specific bond benchmarks.  
  - Example: FTSE World Government Bond Index (WGBI).

- **S&P Dow Jones Fixed Income Indices**:  
  - Includes indices such as the S&P U.S. Treasury Bond Index and S&P Muni Bond Index.

---

## Challenges in Bond Market Indices

- **Infrequent Trading**:  
  - Unlike stocks, bonds are often traded over-the-counter (OTC) and do not have centralized exchanges.  
  - Many bonds are bought and held by institutional investors, resulting in fewer transactions.

- **Price Estimation Issues**:  
  - Since many bonds do not trade daily, index providers estimate bond prices using models, dealer quotes, or matrix pricing.  
  - Matrix pricing estimates a bond’s value based on yields of similar bonds.

- **Return Calculation Complexity**:  
  - Unlike stocks, bond returns depend on interest payments, price changes, and reinvestment of coupon payments.  
  - Many bonds have embedded options (callable, putable), making valuation more complex.

---

## How Are Bond Market Indices Computed?

### Step 1: Selection of Bonds  
- The index provider selects a set of bonds based on criteria such as:
  - Issuer (government, corporate, municipal)
  - Credit rating (investment grade, high yield)
  - Maturity (short-term, medium-term, long-term)
  - Currency denomination (USD, EUR, JPY, etc.)

### Step 2: Weighting Methodology
- **Market Value-Weighted (Most Common)**  
  - Bonds with larger outstanding amounts have greater influence on the index.  
  - Example: Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index.
  
- **Equal-Weighted**  
  - All bonds have the same weight, regardless of their market size.  
  - Less common but used in some specialized indices.
  
- **Duration-Weighted**  
  - Adjusts weights based on a bond’s sensitivity to interest rate changes.

### Step 3: Price and Yield Estimation
- Since bonds do not always trade daily, prices are estimated using:
  - Last trade prices (if available).
  - Dealer quotes from financial institutions.
  - Matrix pricing (estimating prices based on similar bonds).

### Step 4: Return Calculation
- **Total Return Formula** (includes both price changes and interest income):  
  $$
  \text{Total Return} = \frac{P_{\text{end}} - P_{\text{start}} + C}{P_{\text{start}}}
  $$
  where:
  - $P_{\text{start}}$ = Bond price at the beginning of the period.
  - $P_{\text{end}}$ = Bond price at the end of the period.
  - $C$ = Coupon payment received.

---

## Example: Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index

- **Composition:**  
  - Includes U.S. government bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and corporate bonds.
  - Weighted by market capitalization.

- **Performance Calculation Example:**
  - Suppose the index starts at **100**.
  - A corporate bond in the index has:
    - Initial price: $98$
    - Final price: $100$
    - Coupon payment: $3$
  - **Total Return Calculation:**
    $$
    \left(\frac{100 - 98 + 3}{98} \right) \times 100 = 5.10\%
    $$
  - If the overall index return averages 5%, the index value would increase from **100 to 105**.




# Derivatives Markets

## Derivatives Markets

- **Financial contracts whose value is derived from an underlying asset**.
- Used for **hedging, speculation, and arbitrage**.
- Traded in two main markets:
  - **Exchange-traded derivatives (ETDs):** Standardized contracts traded on formal exchanges (e.g., CME, KRX).
  - **Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives:** Customized contracts traded directly between parties; OTC markets are much larger.

---

## Types of Derivatives

1. **Forwards & Futures**:  
   - An agreement to buy/sell an underlying asset at a specified future date for a predetermined price.
   - **Forwards**: Custom contracts traded OTC.  
   - **Futures**: Standardized contracts traded on exchanges (e.g., S&P 500 futures, KOSPI 200 futures).

2. **Options**:  
   - **Buyers have the right, but not the obligation,** to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an asset at a predetermined price before or at expiration.
   - **European options**: Exercisable only at expiration.
   - **American options**: Exercisable anytime before expiration.
   - **Warrants**: Long-term options issued by a company.

3. **Swaps**:  
   - Contracts in which two parties **exchange cash flows or financial instruments** over time.
   - Common types:
     - **Interest rate swaps**: Exchange of fixed-rate and floating-rate payments.
     - **Currency swaps**: Exchange of payments in different currencies.
     - **Credit default swaps (CDS)**: A form of insurance against bond default.

| **May 1996** | **KOSPI 200 futures** introduced, marking the start of Korea’s exchange-traded derivatives market. |
| **July 1997** | **KOSPI 200 options** launched, quickly becoming one of the most actively traded derivatives globally. |
| **January 2001** | **KOSDAQ 50 futures** introduced (renamed **KOSDAQ 150 futures** in 2015). |
| **November 2001** | **KOSDAQ 50 options** launched, providing additional hedging and speculation opportunities. |
| **January 2002** | **Single stock options** introduced, allowing investors to trade options on individual stocks. |
| **May 2008** | **Single stock futures** launched, enabling futures trading on specific company stocks. |

| **March 2018** | **KRX 200 futures** introduced as an expanded market index derivative. |

---

## Additional Insights: Global vs. Korean Derivatives Market

- **KOSPI 200 options** were at one point **the world's most actively traded derivative contract** due to heavy retail investor participation (2000s–Early 2010s).
- Korea’s derivatives market has evolved to **reduce excessive speculation** by implementing **trading restrictions and transaction taxes** (2014).
- **Compared to global derivatives markets**:
  - **U.S. & Europe**: Heavily institutional participation, with a focus on hedging.
  - **Korea & China**: Historically, high retail investor involvement.
  - **Emerging markets**: Increasing adoption of exchange-traded derivatives to develop capital markets.

---

## Example: How a Derivative Works

**Hedging with KOSPI 200 Futures**

- An institutional investor holds a **₩10 billion portfolio** tracking the **KOSPI 200 index**.
- They fear a short-term market decline and **short 100 KOSPI 200 futures contracts** to hedge their position.
- If the KOSPI 200 index drops by **5%**, their stock portfolio loses **₩500 million**, but their **short futures position gains ₩500 million**, offsetting the loss.
- This strategy allows the investor to protect their portfolio **without selling their stocks**.

## Risk/Return Characteristics of Securities  

### **Understanding Risk and Return**  
- Financial securities exhibit **different risk-return profiles**, which are central to **asset allocation decisions**.  
- **Risk and return trade-off**: Investors demand **higher returns for higher risks** over the long run.  

---

## Risk/Return Characteristics of Securities  

### **Factors Affecting the Risk of a Security**  

1. **Maturity of the Security**  
   - Longer-term securities generally carry **higher risk** due to **interest rate fluctuations and uncertainty**.  
   - Example: **30-year bonds** are riskier than **1-year Treasury bills**.  

2. **Credit Quality of the Issuer**  
   - Issuers with lower credit ratings offer **higher yields** but come with **default risk**.  
   - Example: **U.S. Treasury bonds (AAA-rated, low risk)** vs. **junk bonds (BB-rated or lower, high risk)**.  

3. **Priority Over Income and Assets**  
   - **Senior debt** is repaid first in bankruptcy, making it safer than **subordinated debt** or **equity**.  
   - Example: **Common stock** is riskier than **corporate bonds** because bondholders are paid first.  

4. **Liquidity**  
   - More liquid assets can be easily bought or sold without affecting their price.  
   - Example: **Large-cap stocks (Apple, Microsoft) are highly liquid**, while **small-cap stocks or private debt** may have limited liquidity.  

---

## Risk/Return Characteristics of Securities  

### **Risk and Return Relationship**  
- **Higher risk should be compensated with higher expected returns** over the long term.  
- **Typical return hierarchy (from lowest to highest risk/return):**  
  1. **Government Bonds** (low risk, low return)  
  2. **Investment-Grade Corporate Bonds**  
  3. **High-Yield Bonds (Junk Bonds)**  
  4. **Large-Cap Stocks**  
  5. **Small-Cap Stocks**  
  6. **Private Equity / Venture Capital** (high risk, high return)
