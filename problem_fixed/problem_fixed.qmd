# Programming Exercises (Optional)

## Exercise: Bond Pricing and YTM Calculation

Write an R function that calculates the price of a bond given its maturity (years), coupon rate (annual, as a decimal), face value, and YTM (as a decimal), assuming semi-annual coupon payments.  Then, write another R function that calculates the YTM given its Maturity (years), coupon rate (annual, as a decimal), Face Value and the Price.

Show that the functions are working correctly by using the prior problem where it says: "Consider a bond maturing in 20 years, paying 8\% semiannual coupons, with face value of \$1,000. Assume the YTM is 6\%. Find the bond price. Find the price of the above bond if the YTM rises to 10\%."

```r
# Function to calculate the price of a bond
bond_price <- function(maturity, coupon_rate, face_value, ytm) {
  n <- maturity * 2 # Number of periods
  coupon <- coupon_rate * face_value / 2 # Semi-annual coupon payment
  ytm_semi <- ytm / 2 # Semi-annual YTM
  
  # Calculate bond price
  price <- (coupon * (1 - (1 + ytm_semi)^-n) / ytm_semi) + (face_value / (1 + ytm_semi)^n)
  return(price)
}

# Function to calculate the YTM of a bond
bond_ytm <- function(maturity, coupon_rate, face_value, price) {
  n <- maturity * 2 # Number of periods
  coupon <- coupon_rate * face_value / 2 # Semi-annual coupon payment
  
  # Create a function to calculate the difference between the market price and the calculated price
  price_diff <- function(ytm_semi) {
    if (ytm_semi == 0) return(price - (coupon * n + face_value))  # Handle zero division case
    calculated_price <- (coupon * (1 - (1 + ytm_semi)^-n) / ytm_semi) + (face_value / (1 + ytm_semi)^n)
    return(price - calculated_price)
  }
  
  # Use uniroot to find the YTM that makes price_diff equal to zero
  result <- uniroot(price_diff, interval = c(0.0001, 1)) # Interval is semi-annual YTM between 0 and 1
  ytm_semi <- result$root

  
  ytm <- ytm_semi * 2 # Annual YTM
  return(ytm)
}

# Test the function with the given values
maturity <- 20
coupon_rate <- 0.08
face_value <- 1000
ytm1 <- 0.06
ytm2 <- 0.10

price1 <- bond_price(maturity, coupon_rate, face_value, ytm1)
price2 <- bond_price(maturity, coupon_rate, face_value, ytm2)

cat("Bond price with 6% YTM:", price1, "\n")
cat("Bond price with 10% YTM:", price2, "\n")

# Test the YTM function with the first bond:
cat("YTM of Bond 1: ", bond_ytm(maturity, coupon_rate, face_value, price1), "\n")
```

## R Coding Exercise 2: Portfolio Duration

Create a data frame in R that represents the bonds in Portfolio Gamma (Alpha and Epsilon).  The data frame should include columns for:

*   Bond Name (Alpha, Epsilon)
*   Value (Investment Amount)
*   Duration
*   Convexity

Then, write R code to calculate the portfolio duration and portfolio convexity of Gamma, as described in the solution to the problem.

```r
# Create a data frame for the bonds in Portfolio Gamma
bonds <- data.frame(
  BondName = c("Alpha", "Epsilon"),
  Value = c(7500, 5000),
  Duration = c(1.9, 7.5),
  Convexity = c(0.05, 0.95)
)

# Calculate portfolio duration
total_value <- sum(bonds$Value)
portfolio_duration <- sum(bonds$Duration * bonds$Value) / total_value

# Calculate portfolio convexity
portfolio_convexity <- sum(bonds$Convexity * bonds$Value) / total_value

cat("Portfolio Duration:", portfolio_duration, "\n")
cat("Portfolio Convexity:", portfolio_convexity, "\n")
```
