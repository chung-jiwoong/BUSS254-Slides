## Problem

Suppose you want to hedge your exposure to the British pound by using a money market hedge. You have £100,000 receivable in six months and the current spot rate is \$1.40/£. The annual interest rate in the US is 2\% and in the UK is 3\%. Follow the the steps below.

###


(A) Borrow an amount of pounds that will grow to £100,000 in six months at the UK interest rate. How much?

(B) Convert the borrowed pounds into dollars at the spot rate.


(C) Invest the dollars in a US money market instrument that will mature in six months at the US interest rate. How much will it become?


(D) Use the proceeds from the receivable to repay the pound loan and keep the remaining dollars as your hedged amount. What is the implied exchange rate you apply in six months?

## Problem 

On 6 September 2020, Bank A (borrower) agrees to sell £1 million nominal of a UK gilt, the 8\% Treasury maturing in 2023, which is trading at a dirty price of 104.3. The agreement will begin on 7 September, the value date. The term of the trade is 30 days, so the termination date is 7 October 2020 and the agreed repo rate for the (effectively collateralised) loan is set at 6.75\%. On 7 September Bank B (lender) receives £1m nominal 8\% Treasury, which has a settlement value of £1,043,000 (clean price plus accrued interest). How much does Bank A pay to Bank B on the termination date, 7 October 2020? Use Actual/365.
